## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s digital environment, users rely on multiple standalone applications to perform daily tasks such as food delivery, cab booking, hotel reservations, fuel delivery, and train ticketing. This scattered approach results in a fragmented user experience, repeated logins, and difficulty in comparing prices, availability, and offers across platforms. The absence of a centralized, intelligent system leads to inefficient decision-making and lack of personalization. There is a clear need for an integrated platform that simplifies access to these services and enhances usability through smart technologies.
